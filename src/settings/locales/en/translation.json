  "aboutDescription": "My name is Thiago Padovani and I'm a passionate for technology, music and creating new projects. I started my self-taught studies in web development at Udemy, discovering my passion for coding. I’ve got my Bachelor’s Front-end Development diploma by the university Openclassrooms. I have more than three years of experience which most of it working fully remote. In my current role I’m responsible for architecting and designing technical solutions for complex problems on projects, I also present demos to the client and review my team's PRs in my day to day. One of the biggest achievements in my career was when I had the opportunity to participate in a redesign of a whole supermarket e-commerce application with a high traffic flow.",
